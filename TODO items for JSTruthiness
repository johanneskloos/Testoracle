TODO items for JSTruthiness
===========================

1. ES6 handling - major project
   This needs various changes:
   - ES6-compatible Jalangi2 (probably a major project)
   - Adapt trace generator, trace datatypes for new event types
   - Add new ES6 base objects to globals analysis in the trace generator.
   - Add handling of new event types to trace enrichment
   - Add handling of new event types to trace matching (probably straightforward)
2. Correct handling of with - medium project:
   - Modify Jalangi2 to provide scope information for with (medium to major project?)
   - Adapt trace types and trace generator
   - Add with handling in calculateVersionsAndAliases: Introduce/drop aliases at the right
     point.
3. Clear documentation of matching rules.
4. Handle reflection.
